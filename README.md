# 🖥️ Ubuntu

[Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) is a popular open-source operating system designed for personal computers and laptops. It offers a user-friendly interface and a wide range of software options, making it suitable for both new and experienced users.

## Setup

> [!WARNING]
> * The GNOME desktop environment is a bit unstable in this configuration.
> * Desktop themes might not work correctly. You can fix this, by creating your own gtk3 and gtk4 configs.

To use this desktop, change the docker image tag to `ubuntu`. For setup options and configuration, check the [documentation](https://github.com/tibynx/webtop?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).
