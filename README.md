# 🖥️ Zorin OS Core

[Zorin OS](https://zorin.com/os/) is a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu, designed to provide a user-friendly experience for individuals transitioning from Windows or macOS.

## Setup

> [!WARNING]
> * The GNOME desktop environment is a bit unstable in this configuration.
> * Desktop themes might not work correctly. You can fix this, by creating your own gtk3 and gtk4 configs.

To use this desktop, change the docker image tag to `zorinos-core`. For setup options and configuration, check the [documentation](https://github.com/tibynx/webtop?tab=readme-ov-file#setup).
